# Azure Blob Storage

1. What is it?

    Azure Blob Storage is a cloud-based object storage solution provided by Microsoft Azure.
    It is designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data, such as documents, images, videos, and other types of binary and text data.
    Blobs are organized into containers, and each blob is assigned a unique URL for access.

2. When to use it?

    Use Azure Blob Storage when you need to store and retrieve large amounts of unstructured data.
    It is suitable for scenarios like serving images or videos to a website, storing backups, and handling data for analytics and big data processing.

3. Example from DevOps Engineer point of view?

    A DevOps engineer may use Azure Blob Storage to store artifacts and binaries produced during the build process, ensuring a centralized and scalable storage solution.
    Azure Storage Explorer or Azure CLI can be used to automate the uploading and retrieval of artifacts during deployment pipelines.

4. Equivalent service in AWS:

    The equivalent service in AWS is Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). S3 is also an object storage service designed for scalable and secure storage of objects, such as files and data.
